When the frontend queries the backend, it sends the full status of the current search, including the search inputs, the chat history, and the search results.

Example API call:
```bash
curl -X POST https://fast-api-flights.replit.app/search-flights \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "sessionId": "test123",
  "formData": {
    "departurePlace": "PRG",
    "returnPlace": "LON",
    "departureDate": "2024-03-01",
    "returnDate": "2024-03-01"
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Maybe I want to fly to Viena instead?"
    }
  ],
  "trigger": "chat"
}'
```

Prefil the search form with example valid values

Search api should also respond with list of suggested textual filters based on the returned flights, e.g. "early departures", "sunday evening returns", "under 100$", "under 500$". It should be contextual.
Render these under the results so user can click on them.

Completely rewrite the search API logic.
It receives a search form state, chat messages, and what trigged the request, either submitting the form or sending a message.

It should combine all of that to prompt, and send it to the OpenAI API, requesting a structured response of flights.
Then it should call OpenAI API again twice:
-  with the flights and original prompt, and ask for suggested subsequent filters based on the flights (e.g. Under $xxx, only morning departures, returns on sunday)
-with original prompt, and ask to respond to what to update the original form ui, in the same structured format as it was sent from the client

- The whole response should include:
  - flights
  - suggested filters
  - form data to update the form ui
  - short message about what was done

- Added visual connection line between departure and arrival
- Simplified information hierarchy
- Made price more prominent
- Improved responsive design for mobile and desktop

## User Request: Restyle Colors and Styles
The user requested to restyle the colors and styles to match a provided screenshot. The screenshot showed:
- Teal primary color for buttons and Madrid chip
- Orange color for Dublin chip
- Modern, clean UI with rounded corners
- Consistent padding and spacing
- Close buttons on location chips

## User Request: Redesign Search Form

- Location badges with close buttons
- "Add more" text for additional locations
- Date range display in a clean format
- Full-width elements with consistent spacing
- Modern typography with emoji greeting

## User Request: Add Passenger Selector Popup

- Proper limits (1-9 for passengers, 0-9 for bags)
- Clear labels and helper text
- Consistent styling with the app's design system

search form date input should open datepicker

## 2024-03-19: Refactor Search Callbacks
```refactor callbacks from:
const onSubmit = (formData: SearchFormData) => {
    const searchState: SearchState = {
      sessionId,
      formData,
      messages,
      trigger: "search",
    }

    searchMutation.mutate(searchState, {
      onSuccess: (data) => {
        console.log("[FlightSearch:onSuccess]", data)
        if (data.formUpdates) {
          Object.entries(data.formUpdates).forEach(([key, value]) => {
            if (value !== undefined && value !== null) {
              setValue(key as keyof SearchFormData, value as string)
            }
          })
          trigger()
        }

        if (data.messages && data.messages.length > 0) {
          console.log("[FlightSearch:onSuccess:messages]", data.messages)
          setMessages(data.messages)
        }
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        console.error("Search error:", error)
        toast({
          variant: "destructive",
          title: "Search failed",
          description: "Failed to search for flights. Please try again.",
        })
      },
    })
  }
out so we can reuse them in all searchMutation.mutate calls
