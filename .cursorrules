Rules:
- Use TypeScript
  - avoid enums
  - avoid default exports
  - make sure to properly escape quotes in strings
- Use Zod for validation
- Use modern React, avoid class components
- Use React Query for data fetching

- For UI:
  - Always consider using existing components from src/components dir
  - Otherwise use Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind
    - Remember that shadcn components are not in node_modules, but in src/components/ui and imported as `import { Calendar } from "@/components/ui/calendar"`
- Implement responsive design, mobile first approach
- Use descriptive naming conventions

- Follow accessibility best practices
- Follow SEO best practices

After all the code changes, write a short report of what you did, in bullet points, and append it to the end of .meta/steps.md file. Always just append, don't change existing content.
